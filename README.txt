This is a simple web application folw example with spring boot

=============== Dependencies ======================

A web application contains following dependencies
            Spring - core, beans, context, aop
            Web MVC - (Spring MVC)
            Jackson - for JSON Data Binding
            Validation - Hibernate Validator, Validation API(javax.validation)
            Embedded Servlet Container - Tomcat 9.0
            Logging - logback, slf4j
Spring boot provides all depencies to our class path just by adding spring-boot-starter dependency in the class path.

It contains 
           - actuator dependecny to provide ops functionality like monitoring web app,auding,check state of DB,health of running application.
           - Dev Tools to pickup changes quickly and restart the server.
           - HAL Browser.
           
=========== path = src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/.jsp page =================
Configure View Resolver by adding
                                  spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/jsp/
                                  spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
                                  inside application.properties file.
                                  
                                  
=========================================================================

By adding web starter dependency in the class path,Spring boot auto configure DispathcherServlet For application , that  acts as a FrontController.
That handles all incoming request and passes the req to coressponding Controller and controller class passes the request to handler mapping method 
that maps incoming web request with handler mapper method request, and pass response of handler mapping method to the dispather servlet ,then Disatcher servlet passes 
the response to the auto configured view resolver to search for the view page.
By configuring the view page in properties file we tells Dispatcher servlet where to search for view page.

=========================================================================

Apache Tomcat Sever starts at port -8081( configured in properties file)
HAL Browser Expose At - http://localhost:8081
Actuator Expose At -    http://localhost:8081/actuator
